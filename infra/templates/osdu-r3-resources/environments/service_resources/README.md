# Azure OSDU R3 - Cluster Resources Environment

The `osdu` - `cluster_resources` environment template is intended to provision to Azure resources for an AKS Cluster. 


# Deployment Steps

## Source your environment 

Execute the following commands to set up your local environment variables:

*Note for Windows Users using WSL*: We recommend running dos2unix utility on the environment file via `dos2unix .env` prior to sourcing your environment variables to chop trailing newline and carriage return characters.

```bash
# these commands setup all the environment variables needed to run this template
DOT_ENV=<path to your .env file>
export $(cat $DOT_ENV | xargs)
```

## Service Principal Login

Execute the following command to configure your local Azure CLI.

```bash
# This logs your local Azure CLI in using the configured service principal.
az login --service-principal -u $ARM_CLIENT_ID -p $ARM_CLIENT_SECRET --tenant $ARM_TENANT_ID
```

## Define Terraform Variables

Navigate to the `terraform.tfvars` terraform file. Here's a sample of the terraform.tfvars file for this template. Be sure to update the `gitops_ssh_url` TF var with the git url of the GitOPS repo.

```HCL
resource_group_location     = "centralus"
prefix                      = "osdu-r2"
acr_resource_group_name     = "osdu-r2-acr"
acr_container_registry_name = "osducr"
data_resource_prefix        = "data-dev-int-osdur2"
gitops_ssh_url              = "git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/slb-des-ext-collaboration/open-data-ecosystem/k8-gitops-hld"
sb_topics = []
```

## Initialize your workspace

Execute the following commands to set up your terraform workspace.

```bash
# This configures terraform to leverage a remote backend that will help you and your
# team keep consistent state
terraform init -backend-config "storage_account_name=${TF_VAR_remote_state_account}" -backend-config "container_name=${TF_VAR_remote_state_container}"

# This command configures terraform to use a workspace unique to you. This allows you to work
# without stepping over your teammate's deployments
TF_WORKSPACE="dev-int-aks"
terraform workspace new $TF_WORKSPACE || terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
```

## Terraform Plan

Next, execute terraform plan and specify the location of our variables file. Terraform looks for `terraform.tfvars` in the current directory as a default.

```bash
# See what terraform will try to deploy without actually deploying
terraform plan
```

## Terraform Apply

The final step is to issue terraform apply which uses the file containing the variables we defined above (if you run terraform apply without -var-file= it will take any *.tfvars file in the folder, for example, the sample terraform.tfvars file, if you didn't remove it, and start asking for the unspecified fields).

```bash
# Execute a deployment
terraform apply
```
